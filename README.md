Driver Pass Journal Module 8
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well?
The DriverPass project involved developing a web-based application to deliver instructional videos and enable online scheduling of in-person driving lessons, eliminating the need for office visits or phone calls. The goal was to simplify the process, allowing students to focus on passing their driving tests and obtaining licenses. The client was DriverPass, who commissioned our fictional SNHU company to build this system aligned with modern design principles, emphasizing ease of access, support, and enhanced user experience.
Key Points:
•	Project Concept: Web-app for video tutorials and seamless lesson booking.
•	Client: DriverPass.
•	System Type: User-friendly web-application prioritizing accessibility and UX.
•	Personal Strength: UML Class Diagram—conducted extensive research to achieve a professional-level design, gaining valuable insights despite minor errors.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the UML Use Case Diagram to incorporate instructors into the system. Initially, I adopted a minimalistic approach for clarity, omitting extras like instructors, the shopping cart, and payment methods. These were consolidated under the "Purchase Packages" use case as a single entity.
Key Points:
•	Chosen Revision: UML Use Case Diagram.
•	Improvements: Add instructors and separate cart/payment elements for better representation.
•	Rationale: Enhance completeness without sacrificing simplicity.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I began by thoroughly reviewing the client interview and listing requirements, then prioritizing them from the user's viewpoint. This involved envisioning myself as a user to evaluate functionality, such as navigating lesson scheduling or assessing checkout processes and payment options for clarity and sufficiency.
Considering user needs is crucial to prevent overly complex systems that frustrate even developers. By prioritizing ease of use, designs avoid steep learning curves, ensuring intuitive interactions that align with real-world usability.
Key Points:
•	Interpretation Process: Review requirements, prioritize user perspective, simulate user interactions.
•	Implementation: Design for intuitive navigation and clear functionalities.
•	Importance: Reduces complexity, improves adoption, and enhances overall satisfaction.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach is methodical, starting with client requirements and building outward. I use UML diagrams to outline goals, timelines, and methods, bridging business and developer perspectives. The business side focuses on stakeholder presentation, while the developer side ensures clear object and method definitions to facilitate collaboration, minimize misunderstandings, and meet budgets and deadlines.
In the future, I would employ diverse diagrams tailored to audiences and incorporate Gantt Charts for tracking project progress.
Key Points:
•	Approach: Requirements-driven, methodical progression.
•	Techniques: UML diagrams for visualization, Gantt Charts for scheduling.
•	Strategies: Separate business and developer diagrams to improve communication and efficiency.
